He was shouting with rage so much that his cheeks turned purple and his beard was covered in little flecks of spittle. Darren Smith must have done some pretty naughty things to make him this furious. I mean, a lifetime ban on Christmas presents - it's unheard of!". Considerable speculation has circulated regarding precisely what it is that Darren Smith did to arouse Santa's wrath, but no clear answers have emerged."
